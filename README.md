# 3 Klocs team challenge
Let's program 100 lines of code for 30 days as a team.
If you don't know what to program you can find one of this tutorals from CodeCrafters:
[Build Your Own...](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview).

## Goal

We want to improve our programming skills. To do that, we aim to program daily—whether it's a small or large amount.

The main obstacle is resistance: procrastination, distraction, or perfectionism.
To counter that, we’re committing to the following:

- For **30 days**
- Program **100 lines per person per day**
- Track daily progress using [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com)
- If someone misses a day, they pay a small fine

To stay consistent, we chose a project with structure:
> Follow the “Build Your Own Git” tutorial together.

### 2. Enroll in the Course
Start the Git course at CodeCrafters:
[https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview)

### 3. Find Your Repository URL
After starting the first lesson, check your Git remote:

```bash
git remote -v
````

You’ll see something like:

```
origin	https://git.codecrafters.io/5b40f2ab602065df (fetch)
```


Send your GitHub repo URL to `elviejo79`. It will be added as a submodule in the team repository:
[https://github.com/elviejo79/build\_our\_own\_git\_team\_challenge](https://github.com/elviejo79/build_our_own_git_team_challenge)

This setup allows us to track individual repositories together.
