# build_our_own_git_team_challenge
Our team effort to follow the build_your_own_git_tutorial from codecrafters

## Goal
In order to improve our skills,
We want to program a little or a lot everyday.
But Resistance, (aka procrastination, distraction, and perfectionism).
Get in our way.

So to help us fight procrastination,
we setup a daily goal of programming 100 Lines of Code * Person.
Everyday, and then using beeminder.com
Everybody we get a "fine".

And in order to have something to program.
We chose a tutorial from [Build your own Git](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview)

## Process

1. Enroll in the class in [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/overview)
1. Get the repository address from the class. This can be done in your 1st lesson:

    ```sh
    $ git remote -v
    origin https://github.com/elviejo79/build_our_own_git_team_challenge.git (fetch)
    ```
1. Give the address to elviejo79. To add it as as submodule in *whole team repo*. So that beeminder reads that.
1. Accept the invitation from beeminder to join the goal: https://www.beeminder.com/elviejo79/program-daily
